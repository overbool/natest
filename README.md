# natest
A tool for testing NAT traversal.

NOTE: this is still very early and definitely does not catch all scenarios. If
it reports something different than you're expecting, please file an issue.

## Installation
```
go get github.com/whyrusleeping/natest
```

## Usage (client)
```
> natest
your routers upnp/NAT-PMP port mapping works!

## Usage (server)
To run a custom server, install the server program with:
```
go get github.com/whyrusleeping/natest/natest-server
```

Then run it on a server with a public IP address. (No nat issues please)
